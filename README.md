## Project Description:

In this project I have tried to mock the basic UI functionality of youtube home page.
I have tried to use dynamic data as much as possible so that I can improve it later.
All the data are fetched from json file.

Now let's describe the project UI functionality,

Functionality will start with internet checking. If you are offline, it will show offline notification and when you will be online the notification will be changed. It will always listen your internet status.

On the left navigation section, all the menus are dynamic as well as the subscription list
You can select the menus or click see more to see more menus. It can remember your selection.
There are another two different version of left nav section which will be visible 
when you decrease the width of the screen and overlay left nav section when you click menu icon on small screen.

The main video container is also dynamic. When you click on the video option menu,
It will create new video option menu for then video. 
When video option menu is showing you can not scroll the video container. 
You can click anywhere to remove the video option menu.

On the video filter section, filter data is coming from json file as well. 
So you can add or remove filter data from json file.
If you click any filter button video item will be changed according to the type.

On the top navbar you can search videos. If search keyword doesn't match the videos, It will show no data found.

You can click on the user image. It will show you user menu options. From there you can click only appearance menu to change the theme of the project. Default is dark mode, you can change it to light mode. Browser will remember your choice and next time it will open with your preference.
